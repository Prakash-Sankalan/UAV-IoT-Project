This **IoT UAV Project** integrates advanced sensors and cloud technologies to create a smart drone system for environmental monitoring, collision avoidance, and real-time data visualization. Equipped with a **DHT-11 sensor** for temperature and humidity, an **ultrasonic radar** for obstacle detection, an **LDR** for light intensity monitoring, an **LM-35** for body temperature tracking, and an **ADXL345 accelerometer** for motion sensing, the system ensures comprehensive situational awareness. Sensor data is processed via **NodeMCU** and sent to a **Raspberry Pi**, which runs a **Flask-based API** to communicate with AWS and power a dynamic **web dashboard** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Users can monitor and control the drone in **manual or automatic modes**, with alerts for overheating, low light, or critical obstacles. This project demonstrates seamless integration of hardware and software for enhanced UAV functionality.
